<p>Welcome to the Serai resort.</p>
<p>The Serai Chikmagalur is only 250 kms away, making it a perfect weekend getaway from Bangalore. Chikmagalur was home to the very first coffee plantation in India. Today, plenty of plantations thrive on the hill slopes, often protected by dense woods that give Chikmagalur its evergreen scenery.</p>
